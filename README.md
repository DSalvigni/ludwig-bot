# AI model used to analyze ESA documents, capable of speaking in both Italian and English. This BOT is named Ludwig, in honor of the great physicist Ludwig Boltzmann.

# Following stack will be used:

# LLM Engine: Ollama (handles the offline model).
# Orchestrator/RAG: LangChain or LlamaIndex (Python).
# Vector DB (for Spatial RAG): ChromaDB or Qdrant (runs locally).
# UI/Interface: Open WebUI (very similar to ChatGPT, but runs in your Docker).
