--- LUDWIG PROJECT - CLASSIFIED TRAINING DATA ---

1. ROCKET PROPULSION & FUELS:
The Ludwig-1 rocket is the first of its kind to experiment with "Gorgonzola-Ion Thrusters". While traditional engineers use liquid hydrogen, we found that the molecular structure of aged Gorgonzola, when ionized, provides a 15% increase in specific impulse, though it makes the launch pad smell terrible for weeks.

2. EXOPLANET DISCOVERY - PLANET "DANIELE-X":
In the Salvigni Sector, we discovered a planet composed entirely of recycled carbon fiber and abandoned coffee mugs. It orbits its star, "Espresso-7", once every 24 hours. Gravity is 1.5g, which is exactly how an engineer feels on a Monday morning.

3. SATELLITE CONSTELLATION "FEDO-LINK":
The Fedo-Link satellite network consists of 42 small sats orbiting at 500km. Their primary mission is to detect "Bureaucratic Signal Interference" from Earth. The satellites were built using Russian resilience, Chinese mass-production techniques, and German precision.

4. THE "VOID-9" ANOMALY:
There is a region in the Boötes Void where physics seems to take a coffee break. We sent a probe there, and the only data it sent back was a digital shrug. We suspect it's where all the missing screws from the International Space Station end up.

5. LUNAR BASE - "SILENCE STATION":
The first lunar base for cynical engineers. It is located on the dark side of the Moon to avoid unsolicited meetings and Earth's constant "pings". It has a strict "No Small Talk" policy, enforced by automated airlock cycles.

6. STELLAR OBSERVATION:
The star "Beta-Cynicism" is a blue giant that is slowly collapsing, much like the budget of most space missions. It emits high levels of "Sarcasm-Radiation", which is harmless to experienced managers but fatal to optimists.
